# Vanilla Blocks

This plugin allows Serenity servers to have working, functional vanilla blocks such as Furnace, Hoppers, etc.

---

If you visit the [`Config`](https://github.com/Serial-V/Vanilla-Blocks/blob/master/src/Lib/config.ts), you can enable or disable specific blocks that you don't want active/running on your server.
